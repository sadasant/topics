# topics

**topics** is a web application for creating notes by a given topic. It's purpose is to give you a simple, beautiful and fully interactive environment where you can inquire about your favourite things, begin summaries of life events, take annotations from books, classes or any other subject. Access it anywhere with your twitter account, and share your ideas over social networks!

## Some details

**topics** is an spare-time project made by Daniel Rodríguez [@sadasant](https://mobile.twitter.co/sadasant) for fun and knowledge. It is built entirely in *JavaScript*, with Open Source frameworks and libraries such as [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Underscore](documentcloud.github.com/underscore/), [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/), [Mongodb](http://mongodb.org/) and more!

## How to run it

- Run `npm install`.

- Run it locally with `node app`.

- Or test a production-like behavior with `foreman start`.

What changes between the both states is that foreman stablish a environment variable with the port, which I use to switch from using
the `public/` route for static files, to the `production/` folder, which has all the optimized AMD resources.

## JavaScript flavor

I'm using [this](https://github.com/sadasant/dotfiles/blob/master/.jshintrc) .jshintrc :)

## Rebuild the public/js source

- Install RequireJS with node: `npm install -g requirejs`

- Go to the root and run `r.js -o app.build.js`.

If you're interested on learning about RequireJS optimization,
I recommend you to go to the official documentation: <http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html>

## Wikis

It will have a full wiki. (Wait for it)
